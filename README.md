# PasswordGenerator

Our Challenge this week was to create a password generator that would work with given prompts to make it work.
At first I struggled with have the given password to generate to the page but with revisions I was able to go back and fix said mistakes.
The given criteria was to be prompted with questions regarding password length, upper case, lower case, special characters, and numbers and have those results be generated 
into a random password.
